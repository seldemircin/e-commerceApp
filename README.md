# E-Commerce App

I created an e-commerce site by pulling the information of 20 products with axios via FakeAPI using React, Redux Toolkit. In this e-commerce site, filtering the products from the navbar section can be done, as well as searching by product name via the search bar. At the same time, adding and deleting products to the basket can also be done in the application I made.

You can visit;

[seldemircincommerce.vercel.app](https://seldemircincommerce.vercel.app/)

to see my application live,

or if you want to run the project directly in your local, you can run it if you run npm run dev after npm install.
